### scdefg: scvi on Colab for differential expression with a Flask GUI

*This app uses [scvi-tools](https://scvi-tools.org) and is made to run on a
 Google Colab instance with a GPU.   
 The code for this app and more information is available at
[https://github.com/munfred/scdefg](https://github.com/munfred/scdefg)*

By using a GPU scvi-tools allows you to quickly perform differential expression 
on single cell RNA sequencing data.   
Just select cell types and experiments to compare and some genes to highlight.   
It will produce an interactive volcano plot and a csv file with results *in just a few seconds*! Try it!
