### scvi-de-flask: scvi differential expression with a Flask GUI

*This app uses [scvi-tools](https://scvi-tools.org). The code for this app and more information is available at
[https://github.com/Munfred/scvi-de-flask/](https://github.com/Munfred/scvi-de-flask/)*

I allows you to quickly perform differential expression on single cell RNA sequencing data.   
Just select cell types and experiments to compare and some genes to highlight.   
It will produce an interactive volcano plot and table with DE results in ~10s.
